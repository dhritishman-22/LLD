Requirements:

-> The traffic signal system should efficiently manage vehicle flow at multi-road intersections.
-> It must support standard signal types—red, yellow, and green—with clearly defined transitions.
-> Signal durations should be configurable and dynamically adjustable based on real-time traffic conditions.
-> Transitions between signals should be smooth and safe to maintain continuous traffic movement.
-> The system should be capable of detecting emergency vehicles (e.g., ambulances, fire trucks) and adjusting signals to give them priority.
-> It should be scalable and extensible, allowing integration of future enhancements and intelligent traffic management features.
